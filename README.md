## Stackoverflow Rules based on the scope of implementation

1. How to gain reputation ?

   The primary way to gain reputation is by posting good questions and useful answers. Votes on these posts cause you to
   gain (or sometimes lose) reputation.
   > `NOTE:` A user reputation can't go less than 1

2. You gain reputation when :
    * question is voted up: +10
    * answer is voted up: +10
    * when your answer is accepted: +15

3. You lose reputation when :
    * your question is voted down: âˆ’2
    * your answer is voted down: âˆ’2
    * you vote down an answer: âˆ’1

## Thought Process

Understanding the task was a vital part of the process for me. I spent time studying Stackoverflow Network on my
browser, making sure I understand how things are handled and structured.

I went through their rules are regulations to give me a better understanding of every single activity carried to aid a
detailed implementation of the required task.
